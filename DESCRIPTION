Description: Reversible Jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC)sampling for approximating the posterior 
        distribution of a time varying regulatory network, under the Auto Regressive TIme VArying
		(ARTIVA) model (for a detailed description of the algorithm, see Lebre et al. BMC Systems
		Biology, 2010). Starting from time-course gene expression measurements for a gene of 
		interest (referred to as "target gene") and a set of genes (referred to as "parent genes")
		which may explain the expression of the target gene, the ARTIVA procedure identifies
        temporal segments for which a set of interactions occur between the "parent genes" and the
		"target gene". The time points that delimit the different temporal segments are referred to
		as changepoints (CP).
